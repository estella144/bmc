    <h1>BINLEY MEGA CHIPPY</h1>

    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <p>We are a fish and chips takeaway restaurant in Binley,
      Coventry.</p>

    <p>Binley Mega Chippy became famous after videos were posted about it
      on TikTok, with a slideshow showing pictures of it, and someone
      singing "Binley Mega Chippy" in the background. It later became
      viral.</p>

    <p>The history isn't that deep or rich. Things go viral all the
      time, because they do.</p>
